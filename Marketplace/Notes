About this project

I'd like to talk about this project. 
So, in this project, there are two datasets. 
The first dataset, named 'customers', contains information about who the customer is and their residential address. 
Then, the second dataset, named 'orders', contains information about 
the items sold, including price, quantity, when the item was sold, where it was shipped, and who bought it. 
This information can be found by connecting the data from customers and orders.

From both of these datasets, we can extract quite a lot of insights. For example:
We can determine how many customers we have in each city.
We can find out how many items we have shipped to each region.
We can identify when customers first made purchases at our place.
We can determine when people started shopping at our place, and which city had the highest number of shoppers.
We can calculate the total expenditure of customers during their first purchase at our place.
